# Dockerize a Simple Web Application

see: [dockerize-a-web-application](https://tech-skill-forge.vercel.app/challenges/dockerize-a-web-application)

## Problem

Developers often face challenges when it comes to ensuring that applications run the same way on different environments (development, testing, production, etc.). Discrepancies between environments can lead to bugs and delays in development cycles. By containerizing the application, you will encapsulate the application's code, libraries, and dependencies into a single object, thereby eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. Your task is to containerize a simple web application using Docker. The application should display a simple message or page on the browser indicating it is running successfully.
